Part 1:
1. Open ollydbg and load in CRACKME.exe
2. Find code that loads the dialogues based on successful / failed string comparison
3. Replace all cases of "No Luck!" with "Good work!"
4. Replace all cases of "No luck there, mate" with "Great work, mate! Now try the next CrackMe"
  - This is done by changing what memory address is pushed to the registers that originally contain the error strings.
5. After exporting the file to CRACKMEQ1.EXE, all dialogues will print

Good work!
Now try the next CrackMe

Part 2:
On line 00401228, we store the name
On line 00401233, we store the serial number
To generate a serial number for the name, we do the following:
1.	0040122D invokes toUpperCase on username and then jumps to 0040132C
2.	0040132C sums the ASCII integer values of the now uppercase name
3.	004013A2 executes an XOR against the sum of the uppercase name ASCII and 5678.
4.	After this is finished, the EAX register will contain 
5.	004013E2 takes the entered serial number and sums the decimal values of each index of the number (multiplied by 10) with each other.
6.	004013F5 does an XOR of the result of the above function and 1234
7.	00401241 does the comparison of EAX and EBX, where EAX contains the result of the operations done on the username and EBX contains the result of the operations done on the serial number

So for the input user “seva”:
Username operations:
1.	Start
“seva”
2.	toUpperCase
“seva” -> “SEVA”
3.	Sum ASCII
83+69+86+66 = 303
4.	Convert to HEX
303 -> 012F
5.	xor with 5678
012F xor 5678 = 5757
6.	xor with 1234
5757 xor 1234 = 4563
7.	Convert to Decimal
4563 -> 17763
